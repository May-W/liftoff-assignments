# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This program is designed to allow users to create and maintain an inventory of classic video games, with possible expansion to other categories of items in the future. Ideally when a user will enter a new game into their collection it will load information about that game from public sources so the user can also get an idea what the game is about. Using a web front end makes the site available for access remotely, thus, one should never accidentally buy duplicate classic games again! (I have done this several times, hence the idea for this project!)

### Features

-User login, so each user may maintain a list of their own games and only that user.
-Collection by system: user may add consoles to a list and then add games to individual consoles
-optional Tags on games when entered - say, purchase date and location, played flag
-Web front end

### Technologies
-Java
-Springboot
-Thymeleaf and templates
-MySQL
-was it Spring Data that communicated with MySQL for us?
-bootstrap CSS templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'm going to need to figure out how to use a public data API to download the sort of game data I want to use, if that proves possible. For at least some systems there are sites that provide structured data, but i'm not sure about all. It may ultimately have to scrape data for only some consoles and not others.
